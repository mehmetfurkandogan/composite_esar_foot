# Composite Laminate Optimization for Prosthetic Feet
Here, you'll find MATLAB codes for our prosthetic foot optimization project. These scripts cover gait cycle animation, classical lamination theory calculations, and genetic algorithm optimization. You can explore, use, and adapt these codes for your projects. If you have ideas or feedback, don't hesitate to share!
